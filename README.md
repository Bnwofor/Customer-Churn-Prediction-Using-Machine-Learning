## Customer Churn Prediction Using Machine Learning

## Project Overview

This project applies machine learning techniques to predict whether customers are likely to stop using digital banking services. The objective is to demonstrate how data science can support customer retention strategies, improve service adoption, and guide data-driven decision-making in financial institutions.

## The dataset represents customer demographics, account information, and engagement indicators used to model churn behavior.

## Objectives

Explore and analyze customer behavioral data
Prepare features through encoding and scaling
Build predictive models to classify churn risk
Compare multiple machine learning algorithms
Evaluate performance using classification metrics and ROC curves

## Tools Used

Python
Pandas & NumPy
Scikit-learn
Matplotlib & Seaborn
Jupyter Notebook

## Machine Learning Models Used
1. Logistic Regression
## Used as a baseline model to estimate the probability of customer churn and identify influential features.

2. Decision Tree Classifier
## Applied to capture nonlinear relationships and improve classification performance.

## Key Insights

Customer churn datasets are typically imbalanced, requiring careful evaluation beyond accuracy

## Feature scaling improves model performance

Decision Trees can capture behavioral patterns missed by linear models
Predictive modeling can support proactive retention strategies in digital banking environments

## Business Relevance

## This project demonstrates how data science can support

Customer retention strategy
Service adoption monitoring
Risk-based customer engagement
Product performance analysis
Data-driven decision support
